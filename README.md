## Setup
```sh
$ pip install -U openai
```

## Run
```sh
$ python script.py <num_posts>
```

Look at `chat_history_example.json` to see some posts generated with the default system prompt.

## Ideas for generating interesting posts
- Modify `systemprompt.md`
- Try different AI models via OpenRouter
- Maybe change the `user` prompt that's sent in between the AI responses
