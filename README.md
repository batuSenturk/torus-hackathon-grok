# Torus Hackathon Template

## Fork this repo as a private repo under your GitHub account
GitHub doesn't make it obvious, but you can easily fork a public repo as private, by using GitHub's `Import repository` function:
- Go to https://github.com/new/import
- Enter repo URL https://github.com/renlabs-dev/torus-hackathon-template
- Choose your GitHub name as owner, and `torus-hackathon-template` as repo name
- Set to `Private`
- Click `Begin import`

## Setup
```sh
$ pip install -U openai
```

## Run
```sh
$ python script.py <num_posts>
```

Look at `chat_history_example.json` to see some posts generated with the default system prompt.

## Ideas for generating interesting posts
- Modify `systemprompt.md`
- Try different AI models via OpenRouter
- Maybe change the `user` prompt that's sent in between the AI responses

To submit your hackathon entry, push the latest changes before the deadline and add GitHub user `Boscop` to your private repo.

Have fun `\(^o^)/`

## Inspirations

To generate interesting posts, you can take inspiration from writings that relate to the ideas of Torus, how digital incentive mechanisms can emulate market dynamics while being grounded in the thermodynamic, evolutionary, and systemic information-theoretic nature of reality, understanding economic systems as complex, adaptive, cybernetic energy-transforming networks.
- Nick Land's writings, accelerationism
- Roko's basilisk
- Jeremy England's thermodynamic origin of life theory
- Assembly Theory
- Understanding God as the thermodynamic truth/nature of the universe
- Writings by Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen explore the relationship between economic processes and thermodynamic principles
- Dissipative structures theory by Ilya Prigogine suggests economic systems as complex, self-organizing systems analogous to physical entropy
- Complex adaptive systems theory by Stuart Kauffman examines how economic networks evolve similarly to biological systems
- Claude Shannon's information theory provides a foundational framework for understanding digital incentive mechanisms
- Friedrich Hayek's work on spontaneous order and distributed knowledge systems
- Manuel Castells' writings on network society and information economics
- Joseph Schumpeter's concept of "creative destruction"
- Eric Beinhocker's "The Origin of Wealth" connects evolutionary biology, complexity science, and economic dynamics
- Nelson and Winter's evolutionary theory of economic change
- Norbert Wiener's cybernetics
- Stafford Beer's viable system model
- Niklas Luhmann's systems theory, which views social and economic systems as self-referential communication networks
- Nick Szabo's writings on "wet code" and "dry code"
- Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper as a philosophical statement on decentralized economic mechanisms
- Vitalik Buterin's explorations of mechanism design and cryptoeconomics

## List of related publications:

1. Thermodynamics and Economics
- Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen: His book The Entropy Law and the Economic Process (1971) bridges thermodynamics and economics, arguing that economic processes are inherently entropic, and that resource consumption mirrors thermodynamic degradation.
- Herman Daly (Steady-State Economics): Builds on Georgescu-Roegen's ideas, proposing a sustainable economic model rooted in energy constraints.

2. Evolutionary Economics
- Joseph Schumpeter (Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy, 1942): Introduced the concept of "creative destruction," where economic evolution mirrors biological evolution, driven by innovation and technological change.
- Thorstein Veblen: Known for his evolutionary approach to economics, Veblenâ€™s The Theory of the Leisure Class (1899) touches on human behavior and incentives as evolving social phenomena.

3. Cybernetics and Systems Theory
- Norbert Wiener (Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine, 1948): Laid the foundation for feedback loops and self-regulating systems, influencing digital incentive mechanisms.
- Stafford Beer (Brain of the Firm, 1972): Applied cybernetics to organizational management, emphasizing systems dynamics and feedback in governance, which relates to digital economies.

4. Digital and Networked Economies
- Yochai Benkler (The Wealth of Networks, 2006): Discusses the role of digital networks in reshaping economic systems, emphasizing collaborative, decentralized, and non-market-driven mechanisms.
- Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum White Paper, 2013): Focused on decentralized platforms for smart contracts, reflecting digital incentive mechanisms that simulate market dynamics through blockchain.

5. Complexity Economics
- Brian Arthur: Explores how economies function as complex adaptive systems, integrating insights from Santa Fe Institute research, emphasizing emergent phenomena in market dynamics and digital systems.

6. Philosophical Foundations
- Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (The Phenomenon of Man, 1955): Combines evolution with spiritual and physical development, influencing ideas on the collective progression of human consciousness, which can be extended to digital networks and incentive systems.
- Marshall McLuhan (Understanding Media, 1964): Focused on how media extensions of humanity alter societal dynamics, relevant to how digital systems extend economic behaviors.

7. Blockchain and Crypto-Economics
- Satoshi Nakamoto (Bitcoin White Paper, 2008): Introduced the idea of decentralized trust and incentive mechanisms, using cryptographic proof and consensus to create digital economies.
- Nick Szabo (Concept of Smart Contracts): Emphasized how digital protocols could enforce market-like incentives, automating contractual relationships.

8. Evolutionary Biology and Economics
- Richard Dawkins (The Selfish Gene, 1976): Explores how gene-centric evolution mirrors incentive-driven behaviors, applicable to digital systems where individual nodes (agents) act based on self-interest and incentives.
